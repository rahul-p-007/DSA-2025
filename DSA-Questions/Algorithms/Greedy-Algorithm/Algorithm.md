# 🔹 Greedy Algorithms

**Greedy Algorithms** are a class of algorithms that make the optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum. They build up a solution piece by piece, choosing the best available option at each stage. The core idea is to choose locally optimal solutions at each step, which can lead to a globally optimal solution.

However, it’s important to note that **Greedy Algorithms do not always produce the globally optimal solution**, but they often do in certain types of problems, like **activity selection**, **minimum spanning tree**, and **shortest path** problems.

## 🧠 Key Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms

1. **Local Optimization**: Greedy algorithms choose the best option available at the current step without reconsidering previous choices.
2. **No Backtracking**: Greedy algorithms do not revisit or undo their decisions once they’ve made a choice.
3. **Optimal Substructure**: If a problem can be broken down into smaller sub-problems that can be solved greedily, the problem has optimal substructure.
4. **Greedy Choice Property**: A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by selecting the locally optimal choices.

## 📚 Examples of Greedy Algorithms

### 1. **Activity Selection Problem**

The activity selection problem is a classic example where the goal is to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities from a given set. The greedy choice here is to always pick the next activity that finishes the earliest.

#### Algorithm:

1. Sort activities by their finishing times.
2. Select the first activity and iterate through the remaining activities.
3. Select an activity if it starts after the last selected activity finishes.

#### Time Complexity:

- Sorting: `O(n log n)`
- Selection: `O(n)`

### 2. **Huffman Encoding**

Huffman Encoding is used in lossless data compression, where characters with higher frequencies are assigned shorter codes and characters with lower frequencies are assigned longer codes. This helps in reducing the size of the data.

#### Algorithm:

1. Create a frequency table of characters.
2. Build a binary tree based on the frequencies, merging the least frequent nodes first.
3. Generate the codes for each character based on the tree structure.

#### Time Complexity:

- `O(n log n)` (due to sorting the frequencies)

### 3. **Prim’s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)**

Prim's algorithm finds a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a connected weighted graph. It starts from any node and iteratively adds the smallest edge that connects the tree to another node, ensuring no cycles.

#### Algorithm:

1. Start with any arbitrary node.
2. Add the smallest edge that connects the tree to a node not yet in the tree.
3. Repeat until all nodes are included in the MST.

#### Time Complexity:

- `O(E log V)` (with a priority queue)

### 4. **Kruskal’s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)**

Kruskal’s algorithm also finds the MST but takes a different approach. It sorts all the edges and then adds the smallest edge to the MST, ensuring no cycles are formed.

#### Algorithm:

1. Sort all the edges by weight.
2. Add edges to the MST, ensuring that no cycles are formed (using a union-find structure).
3. Stop when the MST includes all nodes.

#### Time Complexity:

- `O(E log E)` (due to sorting edges)

### 5. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path Problem)**

Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

#### Algorithm:

1. Assign a tentative distance value to every node.
2. Set the initial node's distance to zero.
3. Visit the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance and update the distances of its neighbors.
4. Repeat until all nodes are visited.

#### Time Complexity:

- `O(E log V)` (using a priority queue)

## 🚀 Advantages of Greedy Algorithms

- **Efficiency**: Greedy algorithms often run in polynomial time, making them faster than brute-force approaches.
- **Simplicity**: Greedy algorithms are relatively easy to design and understand, as they only involve making local choices.
- **Optimal for Certain Problems**: Greedy algorithms can yield optimal solutions for specific problems where they fit well, such as MST, shortest path, and knapsack problems.

---

## 🧩 Challenges of Greedy Algorithms

- **Not Always Optimal**: Greedy algorithms do not guarantee an optimal solution for all types of problems. They work best when the problem exhibits the **Greedy Choice Property** and **Optimal Substructure**.
- **Limited Exploration**: By choosing the locally optimal solution at each step, greedy algorithms may miss out on the globally optimal solution, especially when choices are dependent on earlier decisions.
- **Problem-Specific**: Each greedy algorithm is tailored to a specific type of problem, and it cannot be applied universally.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Greedy Algorithms** build a solution step by step by making the locally optimal choice at each stage.
- They are **efficient** and **simple** but **do not guarantee globally optimal solutions** for every problem.
- **Common problems** solved by greedy algorithms include **activity selection**, **minimum spanning tree (MST)**, **shortest path**, and **knapsack problems**.
- **Advantages** include **efficiency** and **ease of implementation**, while **challenges** include the risk of not finding the global optimum.

## 💡 When to Use Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms are best suited for problems where:

- There is a **clear choice** at each step that leads to an optimal solution.
- The problem exhibits the **Greedy Choice Property** (local choices lead to an optimal solution).
- The problem has **Optimal Substructure** (optimal solutions to sub-problems lead to the optimal solution to the entire problem).
