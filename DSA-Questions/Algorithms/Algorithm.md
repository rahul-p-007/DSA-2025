# ðŸ“š DSA Algorithms Specially for Arrays

This is a collection of different algorithm techniques that are commonly used when solving array-related problems in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Two Pointer Technique

- Use two indices to traverse the array.
- Common in problems like sorting, partitioning, and finding pairs.
- **Examples**:
  - Move zeroes to the end.
  - Find a pair with a given sum.
  - Remove duplicates from a sorted array.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Sliding Window Technique

- Used to reduce nested loops to a single loop.
- Useful for problems involving subarrays or substrings.
- **Examples**:
  - Maximum sum subarray of size `k`.
  - Longest substring without repeating characters.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Binary Search

- Used to search for an element in a **sorted array** in `O(log n)` time.
- Can be modified for lower bound, upper bound, first occurrence, etc.
- **Examples**:
  - Find element in sorted array.
  - Search in a rotated sorted array.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm

- Dynamic programming technique to find the maximum subarray sum in `O(n)` time.
- **Examples**:
  - Maximum Subarray Problem.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Prefix Sum / Cumulative Sum

- Precompute the sum of elements to answer range sum queries efficiently.
- **Examples**:
  - Range Sum Query.
  - Finding equilibrium index.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Hashing / Hash Map Techniques

- Use a hash map to store and lookup elements in constant time.
- **Examples**:
  - Two Sum Problem.
  - Subarray sum equals k.
  - Find duplicates.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Sorting Algorithms

- Sort arrays to bring structure to unordered data.
- Different types of sorting:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Examples**:
  - Sort an array.
  - Merge two sorted arrays.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Divide and Conquer

- Break the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them individually, and combine the results.
- **Examples**:
  - Merge Sort.
  - Find the maximum and minimum element.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. Greedy Algorithms

- Always pick the locally optimal solution hoping to find a global optimum.
- **Examples**:
  - Minimum number of jumps to reach the end.
  - Maximum sum of non-adjacent elements.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 10. Monotonic Stack / Monotonic Queue

- Stack or queue that is maintained in a specific increasing or decreasing order.
- **Examples**:
  - Next Greater Element.
  - Trapping Rain Water Problem.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 11. Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

- Used to find the majority element efficiently.
- **Examples**:
  - Find element occurring more than n/2 times.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 12. Bit Manipulation

- Solve problems by using bitwise operations.
- **Examples**:
  - Find the single element (where every other element appears twice).
  - Count the number of set bits.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 13. Backtracking

- Try all possibilities recursively and backtrack if a solution is not feasible.
- **Examples**:
  - Subsets generation.
  - Combination sum problems.
