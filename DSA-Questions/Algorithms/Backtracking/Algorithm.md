# üîπ Backtracking

**Backtracking** is a general algorithmic technique used to solve problems recursively by trying out different possibilities and undoing the last choice (i.e., "backtracking") if it leads to an invalid solution. It's a trial-and-error approach, where you explore all possible solutions systematically but abandon paths that lead to dead ends.

Backtracking is often used in **combinatorial problems**, where you need to find all possible solutions or the best solution from a set of choices. It‚Äôs commonly used in solving problems like **combinations, permutations, subsets**, and **constraint satisfaction problems**.

## üß† Key Concepts of Backtracking

- **Recursive Exploration**: Try out all possibilities in a recursive manner.
- **Pruning**: Backtracking "prunes" (eliminates) paths that cannot lead to a valid solution.
- **State Space Tree**: The search space is often represented as a tree or graph, where each node represents a state, and the edges represent transitions from one state to another.

### Backtracking Algorithm Steps:

1. **Choice**: At each step, you make a decision (choose a potential option).
2. **Constraint**: Check if the current decision satisfies all the problem constraints.
3. **Goal Check**: Check if the current state is a solution (goal).
4. **Backtrack**: If the current path does not lead to a solution, undo the last choice and try another path.

## üîç Applications of Backtracking

### 1. **Solving Combinatorial Problems**

Backtracking is often used to solve combinatorial problems where you need to explore all possible combinations, permutations, or subsets of a set.

#### Example: **Generating Subsets**

Given a set of numbers, you may need to find all possible subsets. Backtracking allows you to try each possibility, including including or excluding each element.

```cpp
void generateSubsets(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& current, int index) {
    if (index == nums.size()) {
        // Process current subset
        return;
    }

    // Include nums[index]
    current.push_back(nums[index]);
    generateSubsets(nums, current, index + 1);

    // Backtrack: Exclude nums[index]
    current.pop_back();
    generateSubsets(nums, current, index + 1);
}
```

### 2. **Permutations and Combinations**

In problems like generating all permutations or combinations of a set, backtracking helps explore all potential combinations.

#### Example: **Generating Permutations**

You can use backtracking to generate all permutations of a given set of numbers.

```cpp
void generatePermutations(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& current, vector<bool>& visited) {
    if (current.size() == nums.size()) {
        // Process current permutation
        return;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (visited[i]) continue;  // Skip visited elements

        visited[i] = true;
        current.push_back(nums[i]);
        generatePermutations(nums, current, visited);
        visited[i] = false;
        current.pop_back();
    }
}
```

### 3. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems**

Backtracking is useful in solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) where you must find a solution that satisfies a set of constraints.

#### Example: **N-Queens Problem**

The N-Queens problem requires placing `N` queens on an `N√óN` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. Backtracking is a typical solution approach for this problem.

```cpp
bool isSafe(int board[], int row, int col, int N) {
    // Check column and diagonals for conflicts
    for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
        if (board[i] == col || abs(board[i] - col) == row - i) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

bool solveNQueens(int board[], int row, int N) {
    if (row == N) {
        // Print or process the solution
        return true;
    }

    for (int col = 0; col < N; col++) {
        if (isSafe(board, row, col, N)) {
            board[row] = col;
            if (solveNQueens(board, row + 1, N)) {
                return true;
            }
            // Backtrack if no solution is found
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

## üîë Backtracking Techniques and Patterns

1. **Recursion**: Backtracking problems are typically solved using recursion. The recursive calls try different choices at each step and backtrack when necessary.
2. **Pruning**: Backtracking can be optimized by pruning the search space. For instance, you can stop exploring a path if it‚Äôs impossible to reach a valid solution from that point onward.
3. **Memoization**: Sometimes, backtracking can be optimized with memoization to avoid recalculating solutions for previously encountered states.

## üöÄ Advantages of Backtracking

- **Exhaustive Search**: It guarantees that if a solution exists, it will find it.
- **Simple Code**: The recursive nature of backtracking often leads to relatively simple and elegant code.
- **Flexibility**: Can be applied to a wide variety of problems, from combinatorial problems to optimization tasks.

---

## üß© Challenges of Backtracking

- **Time Complexity**: Backtracking can be slow for large problems because it often explores many potential solutions. In some cases, the number of possibilities grows exponentially.
- **Space Complexity**: Storing the recursive call stack can consume a significant amount of memory, especially for deep recursion levels.

---

## ‚úÖ When to Use Backtracking

Backtracking is ideal when:

- You need to find **all possible solutions** or **one valid solution**.
- The problem involves **combinations, permutations**, or **subsets**.
- You are dealing with a **constraint satisfaction problem**.
- You want to **prune** large search spaces efficiently (e.g., with early termination or skipping invalid paths).

---

## üìà Time and Space Complexity

The **time complexity** of backtracking depends on the size of the search space and the number of recursive calls. For example:

- In generating permutations, the time complexity is **O(n!)**.
- In the N-Queens problem, the time complexity can be roughly **O(N!)** due to exploring all possible queen placements.

The **space complexity** is proportional to the recursion depth, so it is **O(N)** for problems where the recursion depth is `N` (e.g., in the N-Queens problem, the space complexity is O(N)).

## üí° Tips for Solving Problems with Backtracking

- **Start Simple**: Begin by solving smaller, simpler versions of the problem and then gradually generalize.
- **Think Recursively**: Backtracking is naturally recursive. Think about how the problem can be divided into smaller subproblems.
- **Prune the Search Space**: Cut off branches of the search tree early if they cannot possibly lead to a solution.
- **Track State**: Carefully track the state of the problem (e.g., the current configuration, which elements have been used) so you can backtrack properly.

## üìö Example Problem: Subset Sum

Given a set of numbers, find all subsets that sum up to a target value.

```cpp
void findSubsetsWithSum(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& current, int index, int target, vector<vector<int>>& result) {
    if (target == 0) {
        result.push_back(current);  // Found a valid subset
        return;
    }

    for (int i = index; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (i > index && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;  // Skip duplicates

        if (nums[i] > target) break;  // Pruning if the element exceeds target

        current.push_back(nums[i]);
        findSubsetsWithSum(nums, current, i + 1, target - nums[i], result);
        current.pop_back();  // Backtrack
    }
}
```

This is an example of using backtracking to generate subsets of a given set that sum up to a specific target.

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Backtracking** is a recursive algorithm used for solving problems by trying multiple possibilities and abandoning paths that lead to invalid solutions.
- It is especially useful for problems involving **combinations**, **permutations**, and **constraint satisfaction**.
- Common examples of backtracking problems include the **N-Queens problem**, **subsets**, **permutations**, and **combinatorial optimization**.
- While powerful, backtracking can have high **time complexity** due to the exhaustive search, making it important to use pruning and optimization strategies.
